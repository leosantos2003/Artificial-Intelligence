## About

This repository documents the four Artificial Intelligence projects proposed during the semester by the respective University discipline.

1. **Project 1**:
    * Part 1: Linear Regression. The first exercise consists of implementing the gradient descent algorithm for linear regression in Python 3. The goal is to predict farm prices using a fictitious dataset.
    * Part 2: TensorFlow/Keras. The second exercise focuses on evaluating neural networks for image classification using the TensorFlow/Keras library. The work should be developed using a notebook.
