## About

This repository documents the four Artificial Intelligence projects proposed during the semester by the respective University discipline.

* [Project 1](https://github.com/leosantos2003/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/main/trabalho_1_ia):
   * Part 1: Linear Regression. The first exercise consists of implementing the gradient descent algorithm for linear regression in Python 3. The goal is to predict farm prices using a fictitious dataset.
   * Part 2: TensorFlow/Keras. The second exercise focuses on evaluating neural networks for image classification using the TensorFlow/Keras library. The work is developed using a notebook.
  
* [Project 2](https://github.com/leosantos2003/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/main/trabalho_2_ia):
   * The project consists of implementing and testing Value Iteration and Q-Learning algorithms. We use the Gridworld, Crawler (robot), and Pacman environments.
   * Task 1: Value Iteration
      * We implement the ValueIterationAgent agent in the `valueIterationAgents.py` file.
   * Task 2: Bridge Crossing Analysis
      * In the `analysis.py` file, we change just one of the parameters (discount or noise) so that the agent decides to cross the bridge in BridgeGrid.
   * Task 3: Q-Learning
      * We implement the main QLearningAgent methods in the `qlearningAgents.py` file.
   * Task 4: Epsilon Greedy
      * We implement the getAction method in `qlearningAgents.py`.
   * Task 5: Q-Learning and Pacman
      * We run Pacman with the previews implementations.
   * Task 6: Approximated Q-Learning
      * We implement ApproximateQAgent (also in `qlearningAgents.py`).

* Project 3:
